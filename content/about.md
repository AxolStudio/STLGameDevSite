## Who we are

STLGameDev is a volunteer-run organization providing support to game creators of all levels and all walks of life in the greater St. Louis Missouri region.

We are dedicated to establishing an open, inclusive, and harassment-free community where creators of all types of games&ndash; video, board, card, tabletop, and any other unique methods of play&ndash; can share ideas, receive constructive feedback, find resources, and build connections in order to bring their game projects to fruition.

## What we do

STLGameDev facilitates conversation and collaboration virtually through our [<i class="fa-brands fa-discord"></i> Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/mTMKpre/) where creators can freely discuss ideas, share works in progress, and receive help and feedback from peers and mentors.

We promote connection through a variety of free in-person events:

- Monthly social events
- Semiannual demo/playtesting events
- Semiannual game jams (both online and in-person) including the Global Game Jam each year.
- Semiannual educational lecture events and workshops

Sign up for our events through [<i class="fa-brands fa-meetup"></i> Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/st-louis-game-developers)!

## Community Guidelines

We are dedicated to establishing an open, inclusive, and harassment-free community where creators of all backgrounds, beliefs, and lifestyles can work together safely.

We will not tolerate:

- Inappropriate Decorum
  : unwanted attention, unsolicited advice, speaking out of turn or for longer than suggested during introductions, or dominating conversations
- Oppressive Behavior
  : any conduct that demeans, marginalizes, rejects, threatens or harms anyone on the basis of identity, background, or ability
- Harassment
  : deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; disruption of events; aggressive, derogatory, or threatening comments; and unwanted physical contact or sexual attention
- Destructive Behavior
  : damaging or altering any part of the building, inside or out, including furniture, equipment, or other people’s belongings
- Exclusionary Actions
  : denying certain participants opportunities to share views, skills and other contributions; engaging in favoritism; and creating or reinforcing an inequitable learning environment

Anyone violating these guidelines will be banned from events and community spaces (such as our Discord server).

## Our History

Our organization has grown and changed over many iterations since it began as a humble Meetup group in 2010.

In 2013, a local chapter of the IGDA (International Game Developers Association) was established, but we eventually found being under the umbrella of the IGDA too restrictive to the needs and ambitions of community members.

This led to the formation of the St. Louis Game Developer Co-op nonprofit organization in 2015. For several years, the Co-op grew and thrived, supporting our community with events, game jams, social outings, and more&ndash; until the Covid-19 pandemic brought in-person events, the lifeblood of our community, to a halt.

Due to the burden of maintaining the organization as volunteers, the Co-op leadership decided to dissolve the nonprofit and step away from the group near the end of 2024.

The new leadership is dedicated to continuing the mission of the organization and rebuilding the community going forward.
