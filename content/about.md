## Who we are

STL Gamedev is a volunteer-run organization providing support to game creators of all levels and all walks of life in the greater St. Louis Missouri region.

We are dedicated to establishing an open, inclusive, and harassment-free community where creators of all types of games (video, board, card, tabletop, and any other unique methods of play) can share ideas, receive constructive feedback, find resources, and build connections in order to bring their game projects to fruition.

## Our History

This group started as a loose conglomeration of game developers who wanted to organize and participate in game jams around 20XX. Since then, we have grown our members, expanded our repertoire of events and have tried to build an outstanding network for our community.

## What we do

STL GAME DEV facilitates conversation and collaboration virtually through our [<i class="fa-brands fa-discord"></i> Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/mTMKpre/) where creators can freely discuss ideas, share works in progress, and receive help and feedback from peers and mentors.

We promote connection through a variety of free in-person events: 
- Monthly social events
- Semiannual demo/playtesting events
- Semiannual game jams (both online and in-person) including the Global Game Jam each year.
- Semiannual educational lecture events and workshops

Sign up for our events through [<i class="fa-brands fa-meetup"></i> Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/st-louis-game-developers)!
