## Who we are

STL Gamedev is a volunteer-run organization providing support to game creators of all levels and all walks of life in the greater St. Louis Missouri region.

We are dedicated to establishing an open, inclusive, and harassment-free community where creators of all types of games&ndash; video, board, card, tabletop, and any other unique methods of play&ndash; can share ideas, receive constructive feedback, find resources, and build connections in order to bring their game projects to fruition.

## Our History

The organization started as a Meetup group in 2010 and has grown immensely in the years since. In 2013, several community members formed a local chapter of the IGDA (International Game Developers Association) but found that it didn't offer much of the support they were looking for.  This lead to the formation of the St. Louis Game Developer Co-op non-profit organization in 2015.  For several years the community grew and thrived until covid-19 brought in-person events to a halt.  The lack of in-person events which were the lifeblood of the community had a severe negative impact in which we are only beginning to rebound from.  Due to the stress of maintenance, the non-profit was dissolved in late 2024.  We are continuing and building upon the mission of the non-profit in every way possible.

## What we do

STL GAME DEV facilitates conversation and collaboration virtually through our [<i class="fa-brands fa-discord"></i> Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/mTMKpre/) where creators can freely discuss ideas, share works in progress, and receive help and feedback from peers and mentors.

We promote connection through a variety of free in-person events: 
- Monthly social events
- Semiannual demo/playtesting events
- Semiannual game jams (both online and in-person) including the Global Game Jam each year.
- Semiannual educational lecture events and workshops

Sign up for our events through [<i class="fa-brands fa-meetup"></i> Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/st-louis-game-developers)!
