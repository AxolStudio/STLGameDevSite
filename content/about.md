## Who we are

STL Gamedev is a volunteer-run organization providing support to game creators of all levels and all walks of life in the greater St. Louis Missouri region.

We are dedicated to establishing an open, inclusive, and harassment-free community where creators of all types of games (video, board, card, tabletop, and any other unique methods of play) can share ideas, receive constructive feedback, find resources, and build connections in order to bring their game projects to fruition.

## Our History

Our organization has grown and changed over many iterations since it began as a humble Meetup.com group in 2010.

In 2013, we restructured the group and established it as a local chapter of the IGDA (International Game Developers Association), but we eventually found that being under the umbrella of the IGDA too restrictive to the needs of our community members and the ambitious community projects and events we wanted to undertake.

This led to the formation of the St Louis game Developer Co-op: a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in 2015. For several years, the Co-op grew and thrived, supporting our community with events, game jams, social outings, and more - until the Covid-19 Pandemic brought in-person events, the lifeblood of our community, to a halt.

Near the end of 2024, due to the burden of maintaining the organization as volunteers, the Co-op leadership decided to dissolve the non-profit and step away from the group.

The current leadership is dedicated to continuing the mission of the organization and rebuilding the community going forward.

## What we do

STL Gamedev facilitates conversation and collaboration virtually through our [<i class="fa-brands fa-discord"></i> Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/mTMKpre/) where creators can freely discuss ideas, share works in progress, and receive help and feedback from peers and mentors.

We promote connection through a variety of free in-person events:

- Monthly social events
- Semiannual demo/playtesting events
- Semiannual game jams (both online and in-person) including the Global Game Jam each year.
- Semiannual educational lecture events and workshops

Sign up for our events through [<i class="fa-brands fa-meetup"></i> Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/st-louis-game-developers)!
