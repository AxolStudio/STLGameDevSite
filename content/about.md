## Who are we?

The St Louis Game Developer Group is a volunteer-run organization dedicated to organizing events, creating and colating resources, and building connections with game developers and game development enthusiasts of all levels and from all walks of life in and around the St Louis area.

## Our History

This group started as a loose conglomeration of game developers who wanted to organize and participate in game jams around 20XX. Since then, we have grown our members, expanded our repertoire of events and have tried to build an outstanding network for our community.

## What do we do?

Some of the events that we run include:

* The Annual Global Game Jam
* Periodic local Game Jams (in-person when possible)
* Monthly DrinkUp social events
* Monthly Share-and-Play Demo/Feedback events

In the past we have done annual parties and bbqs, in-person talks, roundtable discussions, tutorials, and much more! We are hoping to be able to some of these again, soon!
