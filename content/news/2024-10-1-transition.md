St. Louis has had a thriving Game Development community in some capacity for over 14 years. Around 9 years ago it evolved into a non-profit 501(c)(6) called *The St. Louis Game Dev Co-op*.

In September 2024 the community was informed that the current leader of the *St. Louis Game Dev Co-op* was planning on stepping down and the non-profit status would be dissolved if nobody was willing to step up and take over the maintenance duties. On the morning of the deadline the entire leadership group individually announced that they were abruptly stepping down and the non-profit dissolution had been set into motion.

This was a much bigger change than what had sounded like a shift in legal status, and in the hours following this announcement several long-time members of the group came together to step up and make sure that the community would still have support from people who care. Prior leadership accepted our request to take up the mantle and transitioned over as many of the existing community accounts and assets as possible. The new group began working on plans for what would come its new home.

After much discussion and a lot of work, we are ready, and very excited to re-emerge into the world and update everyone on where things are now, and where they are headed!
