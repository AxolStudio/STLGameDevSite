## A transition of leadership

St. Louis has had a thriving Game Development community in some capacity for over 14 years. Around 9 years ago it evolved into a nonprofit organization, the *St. Louis Game Developer Co-op*.

Last month leadership of the *Co-op* announced they would be stepping down and dissolving the non-profit organization. This came as a bit of a shock to some long-time community members and a small group of us banded together to make sure that the community would still have support from people who care. *Co-op* leadership transferred over as many of the existing community accounts and assets as possible, and our new group began working on plans to rebuild.

## Who's in charge?

Currently we have 5 members of the administrative team:

- Wes Ehrlichman &mdash; <i class="i fa-brands fa-discord"></i> SuperWes, <i class="fa-brands fa-xbox"></i> SuperWes, <i class="fa-brands fa-playstation"></i> SuperWes, [<i class="fa-brands fa-x-twitter"></i> wesleyte](https://www.x.com/wesleyte)
  : Wes, or [SuperWes](https://www.superwes.com/), has been a consistent presence in leadership of the community since the meetup began in 2010. He has a passion for collaborative problem solving through software. Wes has worked at Riot Games, BradyGames, The Gamer's Quarter, Pelaaja, and countless video game stores. He currently manages a mobile development team at World Wide Technology and spends most of his game development time [designing board games](https://midnightlaunchgames.com/).
