## Welcome to a new era of game development in St. Louis!

Since the [change in Leadership](STLGameDevSite/content/news/2024-10-1-transition.md) in the last month, we've been doing a lot of work and planning to make the future of STLGameDev bright.

## What has changed?

First, the big one: the St. Louis Game Developer Co-op is no more and leadership group is now made up of new (but familliar) people. As mentioned above, the Co-op organization was officially dissolved, and 5 of the more senior members of the community stepped up to lead. The decision was made early on to drop the Co-op moniker and start a new group. The pages for things like Twitter, Facebook, Meetup, etc will still be found at the same places, but we've rebranded them to simply *STLGameDev* and built a new website. We are hoping to use the social media accounts much more actively going forward.

Although this is technically a new group, our goal is to maintain the spirit and values of the original group. As always, we want the Game Development community to be a safe, inclusive, and welcoming space for anyone and everyone. We hope to make this group even more community-led than before, making it easier to contribute ideas and talents in ways that bring the community together.

Since we are no longer a Non-profit Organization, we are not currently planning on re-starting membership fees. Although we are still dedicated to having events that are free for everyone.

If you are already a member of our Discord, you really won't notice too much of a change at this time, although we hope to start doing more and being more active than we had been.

## What's going on with Events?

- **GameDev DrinkUps**
  : There are no plans to stop or change the DrinkUps at this time. We will continue to have them every month.
- **2024 Holiday Party**
  : We are actively planning the Annual Holiday Party this year. Things can still change, but the plan right now is December 5th at [Earthbound Beer on Cherokee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CUV5eVqjYPWMsNey5)! We hope everyone can make it, and if you've made a game since last year please let us know ASAP!
- **2025 Global Game Jam**
  : The GGJ is one of our highest priority items for the new organization. We've been working with UMSL to have the event there again for the first time since 2018. This is still in planning and things can change, but for now add Jan 24-26, 2025 to your calendar and get ready to JAM! More details coming soon.
- **Other Events and Game Jams**
  : Although we have mostly been focused on ensuring the GGJ and the Holiday Party will still happen, we absolutely want to have more events throughout the year than just those. We hope to have more Game Jams, the resurrection of educational talks/events, and regular Share-and-Play events, but these are all still in the early planning stages. We will have more information on them later.

## How can *YOU* help?

In order to get a better sense of our current members, we have created a Survey. Please take a moment to fill it out so that we can use the data to work out the best way to offer events and resources aimed at helping our community.

You can find the Survey here: [STLGameDev Feedback Survey 2024](https://forms.gle/8yw88DMSQiErQTnS9)

We are asking everyone to submit their survey by the end of the day on **Friday, November 22, 2024**.

Other than that, at this moment, we are focused on getting everything in order for the new group and planning the 2 upcoming major events. If you have any feedback or suggestions please start the discussion in the #suggestions channel on Discord.

In the near future, we are hoping to be able to enlist members of the community to speak, demo, and help run other events. We will also be opening up opportunities to help us with social media, running events, and contributing to the site. Be on the lookout in #community-building on Discord.

For now something anyone can do is get the word out! Tell people about our events and share the group with people to help get new people involved!

## Conclusion

Before we go we want to make sure to give a thank *The St. Louis Game Dev Co-op* members and leaders who kept the community thriving for so many years. Without your efforts we wouldn't have a community worth saving. We'd like to give a special shout out to Rob, Kess, and Kirby for being so supportive of the transition and guiding the organization through the complexities of the COVID years without dropping the ball on the Global Game Jam and other key events.

As a testament to what's come before, most of you are not going to even notice any changes beyond a few new icons and logos. Regardless, we thought it was important to be transparent and share with everyone what our plans and our goals are.

We encourage everyone to come out and talk to us at the next DrinkUp or share your thoughts in Discord. We are going to try to do the best we can for the community going forward.

We hope you are all just as excited to move forward into this new chapter of the STLGameDev as we are! See you in Discord!
