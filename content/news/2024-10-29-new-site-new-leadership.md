## Welcome to the new Era of Game Development in St Louis!

St Louis has had a thriving Game Development community in some capacity for over 10 years.

In September 2024, we were informed, rather abruptly, that the current leaders of the *St Louis Game Dev Co-op* had all stepped down from the organization and had dissolved the 501(c)(3) that had been formed a few years previous to allow the organization to collect donation funds.

In the hours following this announcement, several long-time members of the group scrambled to take over ownership of all the accounts and services that were part of the organization and began working on plans on what would come next for our community.

After much discussion and a lot of work, we are ready, and very excited to re-emerge into the world and update everyone on where things are now, and where they are headed!

## What has changed?

First, the big one: the St Louis Game Developer Co-op is no more. The organization was dissolved, and 5 of the more senior members of the community have stepped up to essentially start a new group and ownership of the accounts for things like Twitter, Facebook, Meetup, etc were transferred over to the new group. We have rebranded the new group simply *STL Gamedev* and have built a new website. We plan on using the social media accounts much more actively going forward.

Although this is technically a new group, we are trying to maintain the spirit of the original group. As always, we want the Game Development community to be a safe, inclusive, and welcoming space for anyone and everyone.

Since we are no longer a Non-profit Organization, we are not currently planning on re-starting membership fees. Although we are still dedicated to having events that are free for everyone.

If you are already a member of our Discord, you really won't notice too much of a change at this time, although we hope to start doing more and being more active than we had been.

## What's going on with Events?

- **GameDev DrinkUps**
  : There are no plans to stop or change the DrinkUps at this time. We will continue to have them every month.
- **2024 Holiday Party**
  : We are actively working towards making sure the promised Annual Holiday Party can still take place this year. Plans are already in motion and we will be making an announcement very soon!
- **2025 Global Game Jam**
  : The GGJ is one of our highest priority items for the new organization. We feel like this event is one of great importance to the community and we are making sure that it will still happen. Details to come very soon!
- **Other Events and Game Jams**
  : Although we have mostly been focused on ensuring the GGJ and the Holiday Party will still happen, we absolutely want to have more events throughout the year than just those. We hope to have more Game Jams spaced out throughout the year, and we are working out details on starting up the Share-and-Play events again, but these are still in the early planning stages. We will have more information on them later.

## Who's in Charge?

There are 5 members of the Administrative Group for STL Gamedev.

## How can *YOU* help?

In order to get a better sense of our current members, we have created a Survey. Please take a moment to fill it out so that we can use the data to work out the best way to move forward and offer events and resources aimed at better helping our community.

You can find the Survey here: [STL Gamedev Feedback Survey 2024](https://forms.gle/8yw88DMSQiErQTnS9)

We are asking everyone to submit their survey by the end of the day on **Friday, November 22, 2024**.

Other than that, at this moment, we are still trying to get everything in order for the new group, and plan the 2 upcoming major events, so there is little that we would ask anyone to do right now.

In the near future, we are hoping to be able to enlist members of the community to help run other events, and to suggest ideas of new events or new activities and resources, but we're not ready for that, yet.

Although, telling people about our events and sharing the group with people to help get new people involved is never a bad thing!

## Conclusion

As I mentioned early, most of you are not going to even notice any changes. We thought it was important to be transparent and share with everyone what our plans and our goals are.

We encourage everyone to come out and talk to us at the next DrinkUp or share your thoughts on our Discord channel. We are going to try to do the best we can for the community going forward.

We hope you are all just as excited to move forward into this new chapter of the STL Gamedev as we are!
